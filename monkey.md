# MONKEY
###### *Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.*

>1. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly) grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.

>2. The terms are commonly used in [phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics) (a subfield of [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology)) and in the [tree model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_model) of [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics). Paraphyletic groups are identified by a combination of [synapomorphies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apomorphy_and_synapomorphy) and [symplesiomorphies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiomorphy_and_symplesiomorphy). If many subgroups are missing from the named group, it is said to be polyparaphyletic.


## Examples
*Lampreys and sharks share some features, like a nervous system, that are not synapomorphic because they are also shared by invertebrates. In contrast, the presence of jaws and paired appendages in both sharks and dogs, but not in lampreys or close invertebrate relatives, identifies these traits as synapomorphies. This supports the hypothesis that dogs and sharks are more closely related to each other than to lampreys.*
