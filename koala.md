> The **koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)**, sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an [arboreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboreal_locomotion) herbivorous [marsupial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial) native to Australia. It is the only [extant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neontology#Extant_taxa_versus_extinct_taxa) representative of the [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) [Phascolarctidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phascolarctidae). Its closest living relatives are the [wombats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat). The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting [Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland), [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales), [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)), and [South Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia). It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Its [fur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur) colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations are possibly separate [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies), but not all researchers accept this.

## Social life

---

> *Koalas are asocial and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours. In areas of higher density and fewer trees, home ranges are smaller and more clumped. Koala society appears to consist of "residents" and "transients": the former are mostly adult females and the latter are males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominant.*

## Reproduction and development

---

> *Koalas are seasonal breeders, and they give birth from October to May. Females in oestrus lean their heads back and shake their bodies. Despite these obvious signals, males try to copulate with any female during this period, mounting them from behind. Because of his much larger size, a male can overpower a female.*

## Health and mortality

---

> *Koalas live from 13 to 18 years in the wild although males may die sooner because of their more risky lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees, yet they can get hurt and even die, particularly inexperienced young and fighting males. Around age six, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal dies of starvation. Koalas have few predators.*
