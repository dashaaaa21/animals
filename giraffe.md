### Head
> Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, which can reach 13.5 cm (5.3 in). They are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin, and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation, and are used in combat between males.Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males tend to be bald and knobbed on top. A lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges in the middle of the skull.

### Neck
> The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length.Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests at an angle of 50â€“60 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees.The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae.
